# BiLingualy - Language Translation Application

My app 'BiLingualy', serves as a powerful yet user-friendly translation tool, enabling users to seamlessly translate text between English, French, and Spanish. At its core, ‘BiLingualy’ harnesses the capabilities of the RapidAPI endpoint, a robust platform that facilitates the fetching of accurate JSON data for translated text. Upon inputting the text they wish to translate, users select their source and target languages from the intuitive dropdown menus labeled "From:" and "To:". With just a tap on the "Translate" button, the app efficiently processes their request, retrieves the translation in real-time, and elegantly displays the result.
